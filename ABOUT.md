# OpenVPN-Switcher
### OpenVPN Switcher For Windows
#### Originally created for a torrrent box, allows switching between opvn configuration files with ease. Either by random choice/automatically or on failover. Simply place configuration files within the default OpenVPN directory and start switching.
#### OpenVPN Switcher is in no way tied to OpenVPN and or the OpenVPN project. This tool was created as a method of switching “automagicly” between OpenVPN config files for failover and or anonymity.
